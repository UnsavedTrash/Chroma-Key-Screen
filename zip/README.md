# How to use

- Bind the "Spawn ChromaCube" to your emote wheel in Settings->Mod Settings->CustomEmotesAPI. You do this in game whenever.

- The person who spawns the ChromaCube is the only one that is allowed to transform/rotate/scale it.


# Default Keybinds
- The default binds for movement are

I = Forward

J = Left

K = Backwards

L = Right

U = Up

O = Down

- These binds only function when you are in one of the 3 modes: 

LEFT CTRL = transform

LEFT ALT = rotate 

CAPSLOCK = scale

- It should be noted that for scale mode, only Up and Down will affect it as it scales as a whole.

- I suck at quaternions, so the rotation mode sucks ass and I added a reset for rotation incase things get too screwy

BACKSPACE = rotation reset
